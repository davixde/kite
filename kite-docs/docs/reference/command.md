# Custom Command

Custom commands are the primary way for users to interact with your bot. Once you create your first command, users will be able to use it by typing `/` into the Discord chat.

## Sub-Commands

Add spaces (` `) to your command names to create sub-commands, this helps organize related commands into logical groups and improves clarity for users.

## Command Deployment

Whenever you create a command or update an existing one, Kite will automatically deploy the changes to Discord within 60 seconds.
Some times it's necessary to restart or reload (ctrl+r) your Discord client for the changes to appear.

Make sure to check your app's logs in the Dashboard's overview page to see if there are any errors!
